# SAS Analysis - Dividend Growth Rate
### TLDR;
This is a basic data science project on proving true mean/median and calculating an accurate dividend growth rate. This is my first data science project; albeit with a relativly easy concept. I noticed that there were some individual stocks that were giving the impression that the porfolio was performing better than average. The analysis was conducted to determine if that was the case or not.

### Setup
Simply download then upload the file into SAS Studio.

### Dataset
The dataset is fairly simple and was inputted manually. There is currently no pipeline inplace to collect this data. I feel like manual insertion of datapoints is good enough as the portfolio is small and required minimal work.

### Challenges
The most challenging aspect of this analysis was the general understanding of statistical concepts. I didn't study it at an advanced level academically, so grasping things like IQR and STD came a bit slower than I would have like it to. I did take a statistical concept introduction course provided by SAS which helped me out greatly (some of my certifications can be found on my github home page).

Another challenge was understanding histograms as I donâ€™t have a lot of experience with them.
